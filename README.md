Analogue clock built using HTML, CSS and JS.

At first it was intended to be only a clock that get's the user's local time but afterwards I also wanted to add a bit more customization to it.

Things I have learned: 

I. I have a better grasp at position types (relative, absolute);

II. how to work with transform (and especially how to declare a css variable);

III. how to get the local date and time of the user that accesses the web page;

IV. how to add sound
